# K-Means-Lloyd-with-Open-MPI
Parallel Implementation of K-Means Clustering with naïve Lloyd’s Algorithm (without using ML-specific libraries) written in C. 

Ran on up to 40 process ranks and achieved a parallel efficiency of 93% using Open-MPI. (In-depth calculations given in the write up).

Data set used is the Ionosphere data (2-dimensional) [unable to be uploaded due to large file size.]
